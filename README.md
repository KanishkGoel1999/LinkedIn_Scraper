# LinkedIn_Scraper
I believe in solving own problems. So I made a python scraper to extract all my connections from LinkedIn to analyse the same. I had to use Selenium automated webdriver to login LinkedIn and get html page content. Then BeautifulSoup was used to pass through HTML.parser and find all tags needed. Atlast, all the data was converted to CSV file using Pandas.
